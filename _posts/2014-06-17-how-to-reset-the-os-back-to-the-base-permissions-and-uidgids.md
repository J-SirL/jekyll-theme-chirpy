If your system have been compromised RedHat has a way to reset the OS back to the base permissions and uid/gids.

This is how you do it.

Resets uids and gids on files and directories:

<pre class="lang:default decode:true">for i in $(rpm -qa); do rpm --setugids $i; done</pre>

Resets perms on dirs & files:

<pre class="lang:default decode:true">for i in $(rpm -qa); do rpm --setperms $i; done</pre>
