This time I want to explain firewalld for those that are new to CentOS 7 and like me are only used to iptables. This first blogpost is just a rewrite of the manual page for firewalld. This post is the first of many parts how many I&#8217;ll write depends on how many people who wants this information. If I see that it&#8217;s popular I will write a lot about it. In this blog post I have written the command for you to grab the right manual page like this: <span class="lang:default decode:true  crayon-inline">man firewalld</span> when you see a command like this [ <span style="text-decoration: underline;">man</span> _<span style="text-decoration: underline;">page number</span> page_ ]  for example:  <span class="lang:default decode:true  crayon-inline">man 5 firewalld.zone</span>  it&#8217;s opens up page 5 of the command. sometimes you just can write [man page] for example: <span class="lang:default decode:true crayon-inline ">man firewalld.zone</span> instead but I usually type the page number to make sure I am in the right spot it&#8217;s just a habit of mine often you do not have to type the page number.

**Manual page: firewalld** &#8211; **Dynamic Firewall Manager**

**OPTIONS**  
These are the command line options of firewalld:

**-h &#8211;help** | _&#8220;Prints a short help text and exists.&#8221;_  
**Example:** <span class="lang:default decode:true crayon-inline ">firewalld -h</span>

**&#8211;debug[=level]**  
Set the debug level for firewalld to level. The range of the debug level is **1** (**lowest level)** to **10** (**highest level**). The debug output will be written to the **firewalld** log file **/var/log/firewalld**.  
**Example:** <span class="lang:default decode:true crayon-inline">firewalld &#8211;debug[=5]</span>

**&#8211;debug-gc**  
Print garbage collector leak information. The collector runs every 10 seconds and if there are leaks, it prints information about the leaks.  
**Example:** <span class="lang:default decode:true crayon-inline ">firewalld &#8211;debug-gc</span>

**&#8211;nofork**  
Turn off daemon [forking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_%28system_call%29). Force firewalld to run as a foreground process instead of as a daemon in the background.  
**Example:** <span class="lang:default decode:true crayon-inline">firewalld &#8211;nofork</span>

**&#8211;nopid**  
Disable writing [pid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_identifier) file. By default the program will write a pid file. If the program is invoked with this option it will not check for an existing server process.  
**Example:** <span class="lang:default decode:true crayon-inline ">firewalld &#8211;nopid</span>

**DESCRIPTION**  
firewalld provides a dynamically managed firewall with support for **network/firewall zones** to define the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">trust level</span> of network connections or interfaces. It <span style="text-decoration: underline;">has</span> support for **IPv4**, **IPv6 firewall**  
**settings** and for ethernet bridges and has a separation of runtime and permanent configuration options. It also supports an interface for services or applications to add firewall rules directly.

**CONCEPTS**  
firewalld has a D-BUS interface for firewall configuration of services and applications. It also has a command line client for the user. Services or applications already using D-BUS can request  
changes to the firewall with the D-BUS interface directly. For more information on the firewalld D-BUS interface, please have a look at manual page 5 of firewalld.dbus.

<span class="lang:default decode:true crayon-inline">man 5 firewalld.dbus</span>

**firewalld** provides support for zones, predefined services and ICMP types and has a separation of runtime and permanent configuration options. Permanent configuration is loaded from XML files in  
<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>/usr/lib/firewalld</em> </span>or <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>/etc/firewalld</em> </span>(see the section called “**DIRECTORIES**”).

If **NetworkManager** is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> used, there are some limitations: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">firewalld</span> will <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> get <span style="text-decoration: underline;">notified</span> about <span style="text-decoration: underline;">network device renames.</span> If **firewalld** gets started <span style="text-decoration: underline;">after</span> the network is already up, the connections  
are not bound to a zone. Manually created interfaces are not bound to a zone. Please add them to a zone with **firewall-cmd &#8211;zone=zone &#8211;add-interface=interface.  
** 

Example: <span class="lang:default decode:true  crayon-inline ">firewall-cmd &#8211;zone=public &#8211;add-interface=wlp3s0</span>

**Zones**  
A network or firewall zone defines the trust level of the interface used for a connection. There are several pre-defined zones provided by firewalld. Zone configuration options and generic  
information about zones are described in <span class="lang:default decode:true  crayon-inline">man 5 firewalld.zone</span>

**Services**  
A service can be a list of local ports and destinations and additionally also a list of firewall helper modules automatically loaded if a service is enabled. Service configuration options and  
generic information about services are described in <span class="lang:default decode:true  crayon-inline ">man 5 firewalld.service</span> . The use of predefined services makes it easier for the user to enable and disable access to a service.

**ICMP types**  
The Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) is used to exchange information and also error messages in the Internet Protocol (IP). ICMP types can be used in firewalld to limit the exchange of these  
messages. For more information, please have a look at <span class="lang:default decode:true  crayon-inline ">man firewalld.icmptype</span> .

**Runtime configuration**  
Runtime configuration is the actual active configuration and is not permanent. After reload/restart of the service or a system reboot, runtime settings will be gone if they haven&#8217;t been also in  
permanent configuration.

**Permanent configuration**  
The permanent configuration is stored in config files and will be loaded and become new runtime configuration with every machine boot or service reload/restart.

**Direct interface**  
The direct interface is mainly used by services or applications to add specific firewall rules. The rules are not permanent and need to get applied after receiving the start, restart or reload  
message from firewalld using D-BUS.

**DIRECTORIES**  
**firewalld supports two configuration directories:**

**Default/Fallback configuration in:** _/usr/lib/firewalld_  
This directory contains the default and fallback configuration provided by firewalld for icmptypes, services and zones. The files provided with the firewalld package should not get changed and the  
changes are gone with an update of the firewalld package. Additional icmptypes, services and zones can be provided with packages or by creating files.

**System configuration settings in:** _/etc/firewalld_  
The system or user configuration stored here is either created by the system administrator or by customization with the configuration interface of firewalld or by hand. The files will overload the  
default configuration files.

To manually change settings of pre-defined icmptypes, zones or services, copy the file from the default configuration directory to the corresponding directory in the system configuration directory  
and change it accordingly.

**For more information on icmptypes**, please have a look at the man pages <span class="lang:default decode:true  crayon-inline ">man 5 firewalld.icmptype</span> , for services at <span class="lang:default decode:true  crayon-inline ">man 5 firewalld.service</span>  and for zones at  <span class="lang:default decode:true  crayon-inline ">man 5 firewalld.zone</span> .

**SIGNALS**  
Currently only **_SIGHUP_** is supported.

**SIGHUP**  
Reloads the complete firewall configuration. You can also use firewall-cmd &#8211;reload. All runtime configuration settings will be restored. Permanent configuration will change according to options
