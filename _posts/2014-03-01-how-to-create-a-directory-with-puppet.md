## How to create a directory with puppet

If you are creating a website you need to make sure that the directories are in the remote system before you can push the files in to them this is how you do it.

<pre class="toolbar:2 lang:default decode:true"># make sure that the folder /var/www/myfolder/ 
# is in the new system, including permissions
file { "/var/www/myfolder/":
ensure =&gt; "directory",
owner =&gt; "www-data",
group =&gt; "www-data",
mode =&gt; 644,
}</pre>
