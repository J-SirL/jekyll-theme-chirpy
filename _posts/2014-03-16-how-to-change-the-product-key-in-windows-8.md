Do you have problem activating your windows 8 machine?  
Then you might need to change your product key.

**Using the GUI to Change the Product Key in Windows 8**

One method down! Now here’s how to do the same process from the GUI.

First, move the cursor to the lower left hot corner, right-click, and then click Run (alternately, press the Windows and R keys at the same time).

In the Run dialog box that appears, type slui.exe 3 then click OK. The Change Product Key GUI will open.
