> EPEL (Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux) is a volunteer-based community effort from the Fedora project to create a repository of high-quality add-on packages that complement the Fedora-based Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and its compatible spinoffs, such as CentOS and Scientific Linux.
> 
> As part of the Fedora packaging community, EPEL packages are 100% free/libre open source software (FLOSS). Description taken directly from EPEL site: [https://fedoraproject.org/](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL/FAQ#What_is_EPEL.3F)
