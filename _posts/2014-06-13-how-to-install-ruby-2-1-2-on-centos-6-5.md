**1. Fist make sure your system is up to date**

    yum update -y 

**2. Then you need to install the development tools needed:**

    yum groupinstall -y development

**3.Download and install rvm with curl**

    curl -L get.rvm.io | bash -s stable

**4.&nbsp; Setup the system environment using rvm shell script:**

    source /etc/profile.d/rvm.sh

**5.&nbsp; Now it&#8217;s time to install ruby I&#8217;m installing ruby 2.1.2**

    rvm get head
    rvm install 2.1.2 

> Note:  
> you can get a error saying:  
> &#8216;Error installing EPEL, it is required for libyaml-devel,  
> either there was an error installing EPEL package,  
> or there was problem checking if libyaml-devel is available / installed.&#8217; Usually you can ignore this and run the rvm install 2.1.2 again.  
> if you are unsure if libyaml-devel is installed you can check this by typing:
> 
>     yum info libyaml-devel

**6. Check ruby version  
** 

    ruby -v
